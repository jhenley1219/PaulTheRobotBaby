You and the robot will be scanning Principle Component Boards (PCB) to determine if each is usable (below 40% damage) or must be discarded. The robot will display its damage report as a square of colored pixels, with Blue indicating areas of little to no corrosion while Orange areas exceed the allowed threshold. Then, it will provide a recommendation (use, or discard) based on the percentage of area deemed damaged. Your task is to agree, disagree, or challenge the robot's assessment.
