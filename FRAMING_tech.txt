This task is carried out together with the robot. The robot has been technically equipped so that people can work directly with the robot. The robot has a camera scanner that is used to make detailed scans of PCB boards that will be delivered to you by computer. The robot features 10 useful modes including driving, picking up objects, and playing games. The robotâ€™s internal battery must be recharged once a day. The robot does not have a voice module, yet the robot can easily assist you with the task. Before the robot was set up in this laboratory, it was previously used in other laboratories. 

The robot was previously used with another research group in Berlin. There, the robot was used to scan small computer components to detect errors. The robot has increased its efficiency after researchers learned how to utilize its systems. Currently, the robot still has a low error rate. However, programmed logic is self-learning and evolving, so over time there will be fewer and fewer errors. When the humans from the lab take a lunch break, the robot remains in idle mode until the researchers switch the robot back on.
