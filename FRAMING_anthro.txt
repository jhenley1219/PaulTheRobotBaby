Paul supports you in the task. Paul has learned to behave in a way that allows him to work directly with people. With the help of his perceptive capabilities, Paul is able to inspect  PCB boards and send them to you with his assessment. Paul also enjoys driving around, as he is able to pick up toys to play ball and other games. Additionally, Paul enjoys taking naps to recharge once a day. Even though Paul cannot speak, he can easily perform the task together with you. Before Paul came to us in the laboratory, he had already seen other laboratory rooms from the inside.

Most recently, he worked with another research group in Berlin. There, he helped people detect errors in very small computer components. Paul has enjoyed learning how to work with humans, and even has a favorite color (blue) after working with the researchers who wore blue lab coats. Like his human counterparts, Paul still makes mistakes on very rare occasions. However, Paul will attempt to self-correct when he realizes he has made a mistake, so he will make fewer and fewer mistakes as time goes on. When the humans in the lab take a lunch break, he doesn't come along, but enjoys taking a peaceful break in the lab room.
